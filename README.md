# Microsoft R Open Shiny App Container
This Image is inspired by https://github.com/timoklimmer/mro-on-docker. 
In favour of improved build times, it uses two separate Azure DevOps Build pipelines. 
One is used to perform installs and builds. This project here is the application part. 
This will save you 15 minutes in each build.

Please find the base docker image here:
